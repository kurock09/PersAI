## 2026-06-16 — ADR-118 Slice 1 landed (decision state + cadence persistence trim)

### Scope

- `RuntimeSkillDecisionState` reshape to `{status, activeSkillId, activeSkillName, activeScenarioKey, topicSummary}` (`confidence` + `checkedAtMessageIndex` removed). R1 inline re-declarations updated. R7 cadence column drop + atomic-writer fix (same commit). `AutoSkillRoutingStateService` cadence helpers deleted; persistence kept. Cadence constants + `routerPolicy.skillRoutingPolicy` removed from `platform-runtime-provider-settings`, OpenAPI, admin runtime UI, generated contracts. `SkillStateRoutingService` file preserved; turn-execution caller removed (classifier inert).
- 29 files modified + 6 generated models deleted + 1 new Prisma migration directory (`20260616120000_adr118_drop_skill_cadence_state`).

### Why

- ADR-118 step 1 in the orchestrator slice plan. Makes the old cadence/classifier path inert by data shape (column dropped, helpers gone, decision-state no longer carries cadence fields) so Slice 2's `skill` tool can land cleanly on a clean slate. Slice 1 is intentionally not standalone — between Slice 1 and Slice 2, Skill engagement is OFF.

### Status

- Committed locally. **Not deployed.** Slice 2 (`skill` tool) must land in the same deploy.

### Verify gate

- format:check PASS; lint PASS; api typecheck PASS; web typecheck PASS; api test PASS; runtime test PASS. Web suite has one pre-existing `use-chat.test.tsx` resume-polling flake that passes when run in isolation — diff in `use-chat.ts` is shape-only (3 lines), unrelated to the flaky test. Migration regenerates `assistant-chats.skill_cadence_state` removal; Prisma client regenerated.

### Next recommended step

- **Slice 2 (`skill` tool)** — high complexity, must land in the same deploy. New tool catalog row, native projection, runtime service (`apps/runtime/.../runtime-skill-tool.service.ts`), internal API endpoint that flips the decision row in `assistant_chats.skill_decision_state` (reuses kept `AutoSkillRoutingStateService` persistence helpers from this slice), error paths. Subagent model: GPT-5.4 or Sonnet (not Opus per user instruction).

## 2026-06-15 — HOTFIX: runtime-contract startup crash (ADR-117 Slice 3 regression)

- **Symptom:** after pushing the ADR-117 + media work (`260837c2`), the dev rollout crash-looped new `api` and `runtime` pods (`api-6f6857f7d`, `runtime-78dc88bc64`) with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: .../runtime-contract/src/media-prompt-fragments` imported from `index.ts`. Old pods kept serving, so dev stayed up.
- **Root cause:** Slice 3's `export … from "./media-prompt-fragments"` was the first relative import in the contract package, which is consumed as **un-built TS source** (`main` → `src/index.ts`, no build). Node 22 type-stripping ESM cannot resolve an extensionless relative specifier; `.ts` extension fails the emit typecheck (TS5097); no `.js` sibling exists.
- **Fix:** inlined the fragments directly into `packages/runtime-contract/src/index.ts` and deleted the sibling file → package back to a single self-contained module. Zero consumer-import changes (all already import from `@persai/runtime-contract`). Golden single-source test re-anchored to `index.ts`. Docs (`API-BOUNDARY`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `TEST-PLAN`, ADR-117 closure) updated.
- **Verify gate:** runtime-contract typecheck, **api emit build**, runtime+gateway typecheck, lint, golden single-source + projection test all green. Next: push → confirm rollout pods go Ready.

## 2026-06-15 — ADR-118 opened: Skill scenarios + model-owned activation

### Scope

- New OPEN program ADR: `docs/ADR/118-skill-scenarios-and-model-owned-activation.md`. Authored after ADR-117 entered closure mode (ADR-117 Slices 1-5 + hotfix landed; golden invariant test in place). Adds a new product concept (`SkillScenario`) and replaces hidden Skill activation (classifier + cadence + lexical-gate) with model-owned activation via a single `skill` tool. Slice 7 of ADR-118 contributes one additive rule line to the canonical `tools` selection guide guarded by the ADR-117 golden test (the same slice updates that golden test to accept the new Skills line).

### Why

- Three concrete failure modes today: (F1) activation latency/miss — foreground `matchesSkillLexically` substring gate refuses if Skill metadata doesn't literally contain user keywords; background classifier runs every 5 user messages with first check after the 3rd, so even when it activates it's at minimum 5 turns late; (F2) Skills carry only static `instructionCard` + `SkillKnowledgeCard` — no concept of admin-authored workflows like "Instagram-карусель: 8 slides via image_generate series"; (F3) no visible signal of active Skill since the old banner was removed.

### Decision (summary)

- **Three-level engagement model:** Enabled (Settings) → Active (model decides) → Running scenario (model decides). Skills KB priority retrieval + cache key now driven by explicit model action, not hidden gate.
- **Single tool `skill({ action: "engage" | "release", skillId?, scenarioKey? })`** — covers activation, exit, scenario selection, scenario switch.
- **`SkillScenario` first-class DB entity** — admin-authored structured workflows (key, displayName, description, intentExamples, steps[], recommendedTools[], exitCondition, lifecycle draft/active/archived). Steps are structured records with `directive + recommendedToolCall (text hint, not a constraint) + negativeGuards + mayBeSkippedIf`.
- **Volatile developer block for active scenario** — uses existing `cacheRole: "volatile_context"` pattern (ADR-110, ADR-112 Slice 2). Cached system prefix stays byte-stable across engage/release.
- **UX indicator** — inline annotation in the `:::working` block header row, **to the right of the `Выполнено ▾` toggle** (NOT a line inside the block body): `Маркетолог · Instagram-карусель` for Skill + scenario, `Маркетолог` for Skill without scenario, nothing if no active Skill. Subdued color, single row, ellipsis on narrow widths. No banner, no chip, no line inside the body.
- **One additive line in ADR-117 `tools` selection guide** — Slice 7 adds the Skills engagement rule additively to the canonical guide, no second template.
- **Dead-code sweep mandatory** — `SkillStateRoutingService`, `matchesSkillLexically`, `tryForegroundActivation`, `AutoSkillRoutingStateService` cadence helpers, cadence constants, `skillCadenceState` column, `routerPolicy.skillRoutingPolicy` admin field — all deleted in Slice 6. No flag-gating, no compatibility shims.

### Execution

- 9 slices (0 inventory → 1 state shape + cadence persistence trim → 2 `skill` tool → 3 `SkillScenario` entity + admin API → 4 materialization (catalog + volatile block) → 5 admin UI editor → 6 dead-code sweep → 7 UX indicator + selection-guide rule → 8 golden tests + docs + closure). For orchestrator-driven execution: orchestrator assigns slices to subagents, audits diffs, does not write code. Complexity tags `low/medium/high` per slice for subagent model selection.
- **Slices 1 and 2 must land in the same deploy** (Slice 1 makes old cadence inert; Slice 2 restores activation through the new tool). Window between them must be minimal.

### Status

- ADR authored only. No code touched. Not deployed, not committed.

### Slice 0 landed (2026-06-15, baseline SHA 4a0baa39)

- Deliverable `docs/ADR/118-skill-engagement-inventory.md` produced by read-only subagent. 37 ledger rows (vs ADR-118's ~10 expected — subagent uncovered an additional 27 reachable callsites), 35/35 delete verdicts with proven reachability (every caller listed by file:line), 0 unproven. Sections 1-7 complete: heuristics inventory, keep verdicts, `Enabled Skills` block independence proof, volatile-context end-to-end trace through Anthropic + OpenAI clients, Slice 6 hit list, risks R1-R10, verification (lint + format:check PASS).
- Orchestrator audit: 4 spot-checks against real code (`matchesSkillLexically`, `DEFAULT_SKILL_ROUTING_*`, `volatile_context` provider clients, `checkSkillRouting` chain) all matched ledger claims with correct file:line.
- 4 of 10 ledger risks folded back into ADR-118 as actionable adjustments:
  - **R1 → Slice 1:** explicit update of inline re-declarations in `assistant-runtime.facade.ts:~L115` and `apps/web/.../use-chat.ts:~L158` (not flowed by contract regen alone).
  - **R3 → Slice 4:** volatile-context wrappers currently memory-specific (`<recent_short_memory>` / `<persai_contextual_memory>`); Slice 4 widens them with a `volatileKind` parameter (`memory` → existing wrapper, `active_scenario` → `<active_scenario>`). One additional one-time deliberate cache invalidation for the memory wrapper bytes — explicitly logged.
  - **R7 → Slice 1:** `manage-admin-skills.service.ts:~L678-680` and `manage-assistant-skills.service.ts:~L172-175` both write `skillCadenceState` atomically with the decision row; Slice 1 must drop those writes in the **same commit** as the column drop, or Prisma fails with `Unknown field`.
  - **R9 → Slice 6:** ADR-118 originally underspecified — Slice 6 hit list now explicitly enumerates the `POST /api/v1/turns/skill-routing-check` route, `TurnExecutionService.checkSkillRouting`, `WebRuntimeTurnClientService.checkSkillRouting`, and downstream callers in three `*-web-chat-turn.service.ts` files.
- R2, R4, R5, R6, R8, R10 already covered by ADR or are cosmetic / docs-closure work (R4 lands in Slice 8).

### Next recommended step

- Execute **Slice 1 + Slice 2 together (same deploy)**. Slice 1 = state shape migration + cadence persistence trim + admin field removal + inline re-declarations updated (medium complexity, prefer strong subagent — Prisma migration + contract regen + 2 atomic writer-fixes + admin runtime trim). Slice 2 = the new `skill` tool (high complexity, requires strong subagent — new tool catalog row, native projection, runtime service, internal API endpoint, error paths). The two must land in the same deploy because Slice 1 leaves activation inert (old cadence stopped, new tool not yet shipped) and Slice 2 restores it.

## 2026-06-15 — ADR-117 opened: tool-instruction source-of-truth (Мир 2)

### Scope

- New OPEN program ADR: `docs/ADR/117-tool-instruction-source-of-truth-and-native-tool-runtime-selection-guide.md`. Governs Мир 2 only (which tool / when / how the provider renders), not the persona/system prefix (Мир 1, already clean).

### Why

- Model misfires on tool selection: instructions scattered across 4+ layers, media provider-prose duplicated 3×, and at least one factual drift (catalog tells the model to read `action="deferred"` but the real result is `action="pending_delivery"`; legacy `"deferred"` survives only in `turn-execution.service.ts:~5176`).

### Decision (summary)

- Three concerns, one source each: (1) WHICH/WHEN → Native Tool Runtime **selection guide** = the DB `tools` system-prompt block; (2) WHAT+params → tool descriptor (catalog → policy → projection); (3) HOW provider renders → one provider-conditioning constants module (runtime composers + gateway builders share it, model never re-reads it).
- Reconcile every instruction against real code; delete drift + dead paths (legacy `buildRuntimeToolPoliciesMarkdown`, ghost strippers — prove reachability first).

### Execution

- 6 slices (0 inventory → 1 selection guide → 2 catalog consolidation → 3 provider constants → 4 dead-code sweep → 5 golden tests/docs/closure). Intended for Sonnet subagents; each slice self-contained with its own verification gate. Additive-first to avoid leaving the model with less guidance mid-program.

### Status

- ADR authored. **Slice 0 done** (`docs/ADR/117-tool-instruction-inventory.md` — inventory + reconciliation ledger). **Slice 1 done** (selection guide). **Slice 2 done** (catalog consolidation + `agents` reduction). **Slice 3 done** (provider-conditioning constants module). **Slice 4 done** (dead-code & drift sweep). **Slice 5 done — program complete (deploy pending).** Not deployed, not committed.

### Slice 1 landed (Native Tool Runtime selection guide)

- `apps/api/prisma/bootstrap-preset-data.ts`: `tools` default replaced with the ~36-line cross-tool selection guide (images/vision, knowledge-web local-first, document, memory/tasks, files alias-first + delivery honesty, "call don't narrate", `pending_delivery` honesty). No param mechanics, no provider-conditioning prose (those stay in descriptor / Slice 3 constants).
- `apps/web/app/admin/presets/page.tsx` (+ `page.test.tsx`): `tools` block relabeled "Native Tool Runtime — Selection Guide"; removed stale `tools_catalog_block` variable chip; test asserts new label/description + chip absence (6/6 pass).
- **Additive-first respected:** `tool-catalog-data.ts` and `agents` template untouched.
- Gate green: lint, format:check, api+web+runtime typecheck, seed/compile/tool-policy + presets page tests.

### Slice 2 landed (catalog consolidation + agents reduction)

- **A1 — drift fix:** `image_generate`, `image_edit`, `video_generate` catalog `modelUsageGuidance`: `action="deferred"` → `action="pending_delivery"` (ledger R1). No model-facing `"deferred"` remains anywhere.
- **A2 — selection sentences removed:** dropped S4/S5 from `image_generate`, S7 from `image_edit`, S9/S10/S11 from `video_generate`, S13 from `web_search`, S14 from `web_fetch`, S15 from `scheduled_action`, S16 from `background_task`. Each replaced with short mechanical guidance where field would otherwise be empty.
- **A4 — multi-reference fix:** `image_edit.modelUsageGuidance` updated from singular `referenceImageAlias` to `referenceImageAliases` (plural, up to 15), matching the multi-ref API. "Ask instead of guessing" instruction retained.
- **A5 — files comment:** `files.modelUsageGuidance` annotated "policy-overridden: real model text comes from `runtime-tool-policy.ts` `resolveRuntimeToolUsageGuidance`".
- **B — agents reduction:** `agents` template reduced from "Memory and Task Governance" + Tasks Policy to "Memory Policy" only (4 bullets). Tasks selection now lives solely in the `tools` guide (Slice 1).
- **C — projection fallback:** `createScheduledActionToolDefinition` fallback updated: "Use background_task for assistant-side conditional checks." removed (duplicated S15).
- **D — admin UI:** `PRESET_META.agents` label → "Memory Policy"; description updated to reflect Memory Policy only. `agents_block` hint updated.
- **Prompt-cache note:** this slice changes the seeded `agents` default → another deliberate one-time prompt-cache prefix invalidation on rollout (next materialization will pick it up). Not deployed; not committed.
- Gate green: lint, format:check, api+web+runtime typecheck, api+runtime+web tests all pass.

### Additive-first proof (Slice 2)

### Slice 3 landed (provider-conditioning constants module)

- **Canonical fragments (in `packages/runtime-contract/src/index.ts`):** `ANTI_COLLAGE_RULE`, `STANDALONE_IMAGE_RULE`, `STANDALONE_GENERATED_IMAGE_RULE`, `STANDALONE_EDITED_IMAGE_RULE`, `referenceGuidanceRule({ multiple })`, `seriesItemHeaderLine(index,total)`. Placed in the shared contract package (not runtime-local) because `@persai/provider-gateway` is a separate package and must reference the exact same strings — true single-source. NOTE: originally a sibling `media-prompt-fragments.ts`, but folded into `index.ts` by the 2026-06-15 hotfix (un-built-source runtime constraint — see below).
- **Consumers refactored:** runtime `runtime-image-generate-tool.service.ts` + `runtime-image-edit-tool.service.ts` composers, and gateway `openai-provider.client.ts` (`generateImage` count>1, `buildImageEditPrompt`) now import the fragments. Provider semantics unchanged (wording unified to the most complete variant; `seriesItemHeaderLine` byte-identical). The runtime edit `referenceLine` keeps its alias-named form (it embeds real `image #N` aliases — different shape than the generic builder).
- **Model-facing trim:** removed the collage/grid/multi-panel provider-hygiene clause from `image_generate`/`image_edit` descriptions in `native-tool-projection.ts`; kept `count=N`/`outputMode='series'` intent and the `referenceImageAliases` "rooted in source" param-choice guidance.
- **Tests:** updated `openai-provider.client.test.ts` (unified wording assertion), `native-tool-projection.test.ts` (collage `doesNotMatch` + `runMediaPromptFragmentsSanityTest`), registered the sanity test in `run-suite-isolated.ts`.
- Gate green: lint, format:check, all-package typecheck (incl. runtime-contract), provider-gateway suite, runtime projection + sanity (via temp runner). Not deployed; not committed.

### Slice 4 landed (dead-code & drift sweep)

- **Removed (proven dead):** `buildRuntimeToolPoliciesMarkdown` (`runtime-tool-policy.ts`); `buildPromptToolMarkdownEntry` + orphaned `joinPromptToolInstruction` (`prompt-constructor-tool-metadata.ts`); the `generateToolsPrompt` `else` markdown fallback (`compile-prompt-constructor.service.ts`). Missing-`tools`-template case (cold-migration only) now → empty tools block + one `warn` log.
- **Removed ghost-verb sanitizers** from `native-tool-projection.ts` (the four `containsLegacy*`/`resolveSanitized*` fns); call sites now use `resolveToolDefinitionDescription` directly. Re-confirmed zero live matches before deleting.
- **Reconcile:** `files` hardcoded description in `runtime-tool-policy.ts` now lists `preview`.
- **Kept:** document-tool `action !== "deferred"` guard in `turn-execution.service.ts`.
- Tests updated: `compile-prompt-constructor.service.test.ts` (warned empty-block), `runtime-tool-policy.test.ts` (no markdown builder + `preview`), `native-tool-projection.test.ts` (raw descriptions).
- Gate green: lint, format:check, api+web+runtime+gateway typecheck, affected api tests + runtime projection/sanity (temp runner). Not deployed; not committed.

### Slice 5 landed (golden single-source test + closure)

- `apps/runtime/test/native-tool-projection.test.ts`: `runMediaPromptFragmentsSanityTest` now reads the live production sources from disk and fails if ADR-117 ownership drifts: collage/contact-sheet/diptych wording re-inlined outside `packages/runtime-contract/src/index.ts`, runtime/provider media paths stop importing the shared fragments, `tool-catalog-data.ts` reintroduces `action="deferred"` or cross-tool comparison prose, or `bootstrap-preset-data.ts` loses the selection-guide marker / reintroduces an `agents` Tasks Policy.
- Doc truth updated in `docs/API-BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/TEST-PLAN.md` to record the D1 precedence rule, the three-concern seam, and how to run the golden test through the runtime temp-runner path.
- `docs/ADR/117-tool-instruction-source-of-truth-and-native-tool-runtime-selection-guide.md` now has a closure section: slices 0-5 all marked done, final owner table reaffirmed, reachability proofs cited from the inventory ledger Section 4, residual kept document-tool guard recorded, and `cache-prefix rollout SHA: PENDING` until materialization rollout + GKE deploy happen.
- Gate green on this slice's current tree: lint, format:check, api/web/runtime/runtime-contract typecheck, and runtime temp-runner projection + golden sanity tests. No deploy, no commit.

### Next recommended step

- Materialization rollout + GKE deploy (records the cache-prefix rollout SHA), then optionally the separate knowledge-output markdown-normalization slice.

## 2026-06-15 — image_edit multi-reference inputs (up to 16)

### Scope

- Bounded feature slice (no ADR). User: lift the prior 2-image `image_edit` limit to OpenAI gpt-image-1's 16 total inputs (source + up to 15 references), wired production-grade across all layers.

### What landed

- **Contract** (`packages/runtime-contract`): `MAX_RUNTIME_IMAGE_EDIT_INPUT_IMAGES=16`, `MAX_RUNTIME_IMAGE_EDIT_REFERENCE_IMAGES=15`; `RuntimeImageEditRequest.referenceImageAliases` + result `referenceImageAliases`/`referenceFilenames`; `ProviderGatewayImageEditRequest.referenceImages`. Legacy single `referenceImage(Alias)` kept (deprecated, merged in).
- **Tool projection** (`native-tool-projection.ts`): new `referenceImageAliases` array param (maxItems 15) + updated `image_edit` descriptions; references stay "guidance only", output rooted in source.
- **Runtime service** (`runtime-image-edit-tool.service.ts`): parser merges single+array aliases, dedupes case-insensitively, drops source-collisions, caps at 15; `resolveImageSelection` loads N references; `composeSeriesPrompt` + logs list all refs; result payloads carry plural fields.
- **Provider-gateway** (`provider-image-generation.service.ts`): normalizes `referenceImages` (prefers array, falls back to single), caps at 15.
- **OpenAI client** (`openai-provider.client.ts`): builds `image=[source, ...references]`; plural prompt wording for >1 reference, single-reference wording preserved verbatim.

### Verification

- Full gate green: lint (all workspaces), format:check, typecheck (contract/runtime/provider-gateway/api/web). Tests: runtime media-request-parsing 13/13 (3 new multi-ref cases), full runtime suite pass, provider-gateway openai-client + image-generation-service pass (new multi-ref assertions).
- NOT deployed to `persai-dev`; NOT committed (pending user direction).

### Next recommended step

- Commit + deploy; live-test `image_edit` with 3+ reference aliases for `alex@agse.ru` and confirm OpenAI receives source + all refs (watch `[image-edit] ... referenceAliases=[...]` log).

## 2026-06-15 — Image gen/edit silent-cut + missing-prompt bugfix

### Scope

- Bounded bugfix slice (no ADR). Triaged a `persai-dev` incident for `alex@agse.ru`: image carousel turn cut off mid-reply with **no error** and produced no image; re-asking worked.

### Root cause (from kubectl logs, turn `c8c44383`)

1. **Silent stream cut:** the web `slow_avg` cadence watchdog (`avgThresholdMs=200`) fired on the slow post-tool wrap-up answer (observed `rollingAvgMs=322`) and aborted the runtime fetch. Side-effect turns are not safe to retry, so the reply stayed truncated.
2. **No image:** the `image_edit` call shipped `outputMode="series"` + 4 `seriesItems` but **no top-level `prompt`**, so the parser returned `invalid_arguments` → `skipped` → `/media-jobs/enqueue` was never called (confirmed: enqueue present for the working retries `4b02033a`/`e95161b3`, absent for `c8c44383`).

### What landed

- `apps/api/.../cadence-watchdog.ts`: `slow_avg` disabled for the rest of a span once any tool starts (`recordToolStarted`); pure-text turns unchanged. New regression test.
- `apps/runtime/.../runtime-image-edit-tool.service.ts` + `runtime-image-generate-tool.service.ts`: `prompt` optional in series mode (synthesized overall prompt); non-series still requires it. Added `requestId`-tagged `skipped` warn logs to previously silent branches. New parser tests.

### Verification

- Gate green: api/runtime/web typecheck, format:check, lint (api+runtime). Tests: cadence-watchdog 22/22, runtime media-request-parsing 10/10.
- NOT yet deployed to `persai-dev`; NOT committed (clean-tree change pending user direction).

### Next recommended step

- Deploy to `persai-dev` and re-run the original carousel flow for `alex@agse.ru` to confirm: full reply (no cut) + job enqueued. Watch new `[image-edit]/[image-generate] skipped reason=...` logs to catch any other skip causes.

## 2026-06-14 — ADR-116 closed (file re-view: inspect, read, preview)

### Baseline

- `ff9e4cbb` on `main`; deployed to `persai-dev` (`runtime`, `provider-gateway`, `api`, `web`).

### What landed (116.0–116.3)

- **116.0:** `files.inspect` / contract `files.preview`; plan `maxFilePreviewBytes` + `maxFilePreviewEdgePx`; Admin Plans UI; materialized `RuntimeToolPolicy`; capability matrix.
- **116.1:** `files.read` metadata (`charCount`, `truncated`, `readNote`, `extractionCached`, `extractionQuality`); sanitizer clip truth; extract API `cached: true` on hits.
- **116.2:** `files.preview` for `image/*` + native PDF; ephemeral `toolFollowUpUserContent` injection; unified hydration byte/edge limits from bundle.
- **116.3:** focused unit tests, doc truth (`API-BOUNDARY`, `TEST-PLAN`, `DATA-MODEL`), live acceptance on `persai-dev` — all four checklist items PASS (see ADR-116 closure table).

### Verification

- Repo gate at `ff9e4cbb`: lint, format:check, typecheck, test, test:step2.
- Live: `files.preview` on historical images; `preview_size_limit` at plan limit 25 bytes; success at 8 MB with `file_preview` runtime log.

### Next recommended step

- No open ADR-116 work. Await explicit user priority for the next program (e.g. skill scenarios consumer of `files.preview`, or unrelated slice).

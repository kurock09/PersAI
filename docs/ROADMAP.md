## Step 12 Admin-Driven Runtime Control Plane

- [x] H1 — runtime provider profile baseline (OpenAI + Anthropic, primary/fallback model refs, encrypted credential refs; ADR-050)
- [x] H1a — admin UI for provider profile (structured editor in rollout controls)
- [x] H1b — global provider settings (admin UI for API keys, models, `availableModelsByProvider`; ADR-051)
- [x] H2 — tool credentials and quota limits (8-tool catalog, per-tool daily limits, admin tool credentials UI; ADR-052)
- [x] H2a — tool/plan cleanup (single-source catalog, dead flags removal, per-plan `primaryModelKey` + quota limits, `dailyCallLimit` enforcement)
- [x] H3 — runtime hydration (persona, memory, workspace isolation; ADR-053)
  - [x] H3a — persona: traits/avatar/birthday schema, 7 bootstrap docs, `PERSAI_WORKSPACE_ROOT` + GCS FUSE
  - [x] H3b — memory: OpenClaw memory API, PersAI proxy, Memory Center UI
  - [x] H3c — chat history: message pagination endpoint, UI load-on-open
- [x] H4 — assistant lifecycle audit (create/edit/reset verification)
  - [x] H4a — create: fixed `tone` → `playfulness` trait key mismatch
  - [x] H4b — edit: verified correct (bootstrap write-once preserved)
  - [x] H4c — reset: fixed 3 bugs (traits/avatar copy, stale BOOTSTRAP.md)
  - [x] H4d — UI completeness: action buttons, avatar picker, file upload
- [x] H5 — assistant lifecycle rework (CREATE/EDIT/RESET)
  - [x] H5a — EDIT: single "Save and apply" button
  - [x] H5b — RESET: full wipe (chats, memory, specs, workspace files)
  - [x] H5c — admin-editable bootstrap presets (`{{placeholder}}` templates, admin UI)
- [x] H6 — lazy invalidation for scale (ADR-054, designed for 5 000–10 000 users)
  - [x] H6a — `configGeneration` counter + `configDirtyAt` per-assistant flag
  - [x] H6b — OpenClaw two-tier freshness check (cached generation + PersAI endpoint)
  - [x] H6c — Force Reapply All admin action (step-up protected)
  - [x] H6d — Force Reapply bumps `configGeneration` before re-materialization
- [x] H7 — runtime integration hardening
  - [x] H7a — OpenClaw credential refs dual-format parser (Object + Array)
  - [x] H7b — `AsyncLocalStorage` per-request context (eliminates `process.env` race)
  - [x] H7c — tool catalog rename (`memory_get`, `cron`) + SQL data migration
  - [x] H7d — auto-seed platform data at API startup (`SeedToolCatalogService`)
  - [x] H7e — null-plan governance backfill (legacy assistants get default plan on startup)
- [x] H8 — Telegram runtime readiness (end-to-end delivery + group chats)
  - [x] H8a — encrypted bot token storage (`PlatformRuntimeProviderSecretStoreService`, per-assistant key)
  - [x] H8b — materialize Telegram config into `openclawBootstrap.channels.telegram`
  - [x] H8c — OpenClaw Telegram bridge (`persai-runtime-telegram.ts`): dynamic Grammy bot manager, webhook/polling, group tracking
  - [x] H8d — GKE Ingress for public webhook URL (`bot.persai.dev/telegram-webhook/*`)
  - [x] H8e — Prisma `assistant_telegram_groups` table + internal callback endpoint
  - [x] H8f — UI: Groups section, Group reply mode toggle, Disconnect/Reconnect buttons
  - [x] H8g — polling fallback (no `webhookUrl` → Grammy long polling, no public domain required)
  - [x] H8h — auto-apply on connect/disconnect (immediate OpenClaw spec sync)
  - [x] H8i — Telegram workspace isolation (agent turns use per-assistant `workspaceDir`, shared memory with web chat)
  - [x] H8j — fix `workspaceDir` race condition (`process.env` → `commandInput` passthrough)
  - [x] H8k — fix session `cwd` drift + memory tools workspace: sync `header.cwd` on every turn, route memory reads through `persaiRuntimeRequestContext.workspaceDir`
  - [x] H8l — fix group-update callback: read `baseUrl` from `cfg.secrets.providers["persai-runtime"]` (not nonexistent top-level key)
- [x] H9 — per-request credential isolation (ADR-055, eliminates `process.env` race at 1000+ concurrent users)
  - [x] H9a — extend `PersaiRuntimeRequestCtx` with `toolCredentials` + `getPersaiToolCredential` helper
  - [x] H9b — remove `process.env` mutation from `persai-runtime-agent-turn.ts` (sync, telegram, stream)
  - [x] H9c — patch credential readers (Tavily, Firecrawl, web-fetch) to read from context first
  - [x] H9d — new `plugin-sdk/persai-credential` subpath for extension boundary compliance
  - [x] H9e — systemic credential centralization: replace per-tool `getPersaiToolCredential` with centralized `resolvePersaiToolCredentialForEnvVars` + `withPersaiActiveTool` context wrapper; integrate into `model-auth-env` so all provider auth resolution prioritizes PersAI-injected credentials
  - [x] H9f — fix dead credential paths for `web_search` (Tavily provider selection), `tts` (OpenAI + ElevenLabs), `image_generate`, `web_fetch` (Firecrawl), and `memory_search` embeddings
  - [x] H9g — admin plan UI: expose `toolCostDriving` and `toolCostDrivingQuotaGoverned` flags with descriptive labels in plan management
- [x] H10 — thinking/reasoning UX (stream thinking tokens, collapsible "Thought for Xs" block with fade-out preview)
  - [x] H10a — OpenClaw NDJSON thinking stream for PersAI web runtime
  - [x] H10b — API/Web SSE transport for `thinking` events
  - [x] H10c — web chat Thought block with collapsed preview and duration label
- [x] UI polish — chat scroll, sidebar, avatar upload, Telegram sync
  - [x] UP1 — reverse-paginated chat history (load last 20, lazy-load older on scroll up via IntersectionObserver)
  - [x] UP2 — new chat appears in sidebar immediately on creation
  - [x] UP3 — avatar file upload to workspace (POST/GET endpoints in PersAI API + OpenClaw gateway, replaces blob: URLs)
  - [x] UP4 — Telegram bot profile sync (setMyName, setMyDescription, setMyProfilePhoto on every apply)
- [x] Quota UX and avatar consistency hardening
  - [x] QA1 — quota/capability 409 errors mapped to user-friendly messages (plan limit, feature unavailable)
  - [x] QA2 — reapply/publish POST endpoints return HTTP 200 (was 201); frontend uses `isSuccessStatus` guard
  - [x] QA3 — shared `AssistantAvatar` component (sm/md/lg) replaces all hardcoded Sparkles across chat header, messages, empty state, home dashboard, sidebar
  - [x] QA4 — avatar cache-busting (minute-granularity `?v=` param) + backend `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`
  - [x] QA5 — Telegram binding metadata sync on publish (displayName + avatarUrl patched in DB after apply)
  - [x] QA6 — Telegram settings UI shows assistant draft avatar/name instead of stale getMe data
- [x] Streaming quality hardening
  - [x] SQ1 — `res.flush()` after each SSE write (eliminates Node/TCP buffering delay)
  - [x] SQ2 — remove `accumulated` from delta SSE events (O(token) payload instead of O(total))
  - [x] SQ3 — `requestAnimationFrame` batching for `onDelta`/`onThinking` setState (1 render per frame)
- [x] Telegram group deduplication (supergroup migration fix + title refresh on rename)
  - [x] TG1 — backend: on `joined` event, mark stale active records with same title as "left" before upsert
  - [x] TG2 — backend: GET groups deduplicates by title (keeps most recently updated)
  - [x] TG3 — frontend: groups list shows only active groups
- [x] H8-scale — Telegram runtime lifecycle hardening for 1000+ users
  - design note: ADR-057 defines assistant-scoped runtime reconcile and corrected single-assistant freshness semantics
  - rule: user settings changes stay partial/assistant-scoped; broad reapply remains admin/platform-only
  - [x] H8s1 — stop restarting Telegram bots on every no-op `spec apply`; only rotate runtime bot state when token/webhook mode/webhook URL actually changed
  - [x] H8s2 — remove eager `syncBotProfile` from startup/reinit path; run profile sync only after real persona/avatar changes or explicit reconnect
  - [x] H8s3 — persist Telegram runtime/profile fingerprints (`botToken` hash, webhook mode/url, persona hash, avatar hash) so sync decisions are idempotent
  - [x] H8s3.1 — correct `ensure-fresh-spec`: return fresh single-assistant spec for local OpenClaw reconcile instead of backend-side `full apply`
  - [x] H8s4 — add bounded startup/reinit concurrency with jitter/backoff instead of reinitializing all bots at once
  - [x] H8s5 — add cooldown/rate-limit guards for `setMyName` / `setMyDescription` / `setMyProfilePhoto` to prevent Telegram `429` storms
  - [x] H8s6 — keep startup cheap and readiness-safe: defer non-critical Telegram profile work until after gateway becomes ready
  - [x] H8s8 — add runtime session lifecycle control: clear `agent:persai:<assistantId>:*` sessions on assistant reset/recreate, enforce TTL/GC for stale channel sessions, and keep session growth bounded for 1000+ users
  - [x] H8s9 — full session purge on reset/recreate: delete all runtime sessions (`agent:main` + `agent:persai`) for the assistant's workspace and delete per-chat sessions on web chat deletion; policy decision: no archive, full purge
  - [x] H8s10 — Telegram SaaS hardening: owner-only DM default, owner claim deep-link onboarding, honest `claim_required|connected|invalid_token` state, duplicate `update_id` dedupe, and terminal Telegram auth failure handling
- [x] H12 — Cron webhook callback + preferred notification channel + memory lifecycle
  - [x] H12a — Prisma: `preferredNotificationChannel` field on assistant model + migration
  - [x] H12b — PersAI API: `POST /api/internal/cron-fire` webhook endpoint (current scope: receives OpenClaw cron callback, updates registry rows, delivers directly to Telegram when the assistant has an active Telegram binding plus a known inbound chat target, otherwise falls back to the dedicated web reminders chat; future WhatsApp/MAX outbound remains outside H12 scope)
  - [x] H12c — OpenClaw `persai-runtime-context.ts`: add `cronWebhookUrl` to request context (PersAI-only file)
  - [x] H12d — OpenClaw `cron-tool.ts`: auto-inject `delivery: { mode: "webhook", to: cronWebhookUrl }` from context (~5 lines, same pattern as toolDenyList)
  - [x] H12e — UI: notification channel toggle in assistant settings (shows only connected channels)
  - [x] H12f — Update `PERSAI-FORK-PATCHES.md` + `verify-persai-patches.mjs` with new patch entry
  - [x] H12g — Memory lifecycle on assistant create/reset: if `MEMORY.md` / `memory/` don't exist → create; if exist → clear. On edit/update — do NOT touch memory (implemented via minimal `openclaw/src/gateway/persai-runtime/*` bridge because pure API-only ownership was not technically viable)
  - [x] H12h — PersAI-owned reminders/tasks replace product dependence on native `cron`: current scope covers internal registry upsert/delete by `externalRef`, hard-delete on assistant reset, one-time disappearance after successful webhook finish, recurring rows staying live with updated `nextRunAt`, new product-facing `reminder_task` tool for create/list/pause/resume/cancel, plan/seed policy that hides user-facing `cron`, PersAI-owned write control-plane (`reminder_task` -> PersAI internal control endpoint -> backend-driven internal cron control via `persai-runtime`), Telegram-safe context-only session lookup during create, and delivery-side stripping of internal `Recent context` artifacts from user-visible reminder messages; future WhatsApp/MAX outbound or a backend-owned timer are separate follow-up work, not H12 blockers
- [x] H13 — Unified messenger turn gateway
  - [x] H13a — single PersAI API entry point for web + Telegram turns, with reminder callback ingress normalized under the same backend error/render family; future WhatsApp/MAX/VK can follow the same PersAI adapter pattern
  - [x] H13b — unified enforcement: quota (tokens, messages), rate limits, and per-tool daily limits now apply across the supported inbound turn surfaces (`web_chat`, `telegram`, `reminder_callback` policy ingress), with runtime tool calls gated through a minimal existing OpenClaw `before_tool_call` seam
  - [x] H13c — human-readable error messages across web, Telegram, and reminder callback delivery now render from the same backend code family
  - [x] H13d — adapter pattern: new messenger = new adapter in PersAI API, OpenClaw stays a thin runtime executor via `/api/v1/runtime/chat/channel`
  - [x] H13e — stable backend error codes replace string-only UX heuristics for shared web/Telegram/reminder-facing failure semantics

## Step 13 Media, Attachments, and Voice (M-series, ADR-059)

- [x] M1 — media foundation (DB model, storage, contracts, cleanup, quota dimension)
  - [x] M1a — Prisma: `assistant_chat_message_attachments` table + `media_storage_bytes` quota extension + migration
  - [x] M1b — `AssistantChatMessageAttachmentRepository` (create, findByMessageIds, findById, deleteByMessageIds, deleteByChatId, deleteByAssistantId)
  - [x] M1c — OpenClaw bridge: workspace media upload/download/delete-chat HTTP handlers (`persai-runtime-media.ts`)
  - [x] M1d — PersAI adapter: `uploadChatMedia`, `downloadChatMedia`, `deleteChatMedia` on `OpenClawRuntimeAdapter`
  - [x] M1e — API endpoints: `POST /assistant/chat/:chatId/message/:messageId/attachment` (multipart) + `GET /assistant/attachment/:attachmentId` (proxy download)
  - [x] M1f — extend message history response with `attachments[]`
  - [x] M1g — extend `hardDeleteChat` with media directory cleanup + attachment row deletion
  - [x] M1h — extend `resetAssistant` transaction with `assistant_chat_message_attachments.deleteMany`
  - [x] M1i — `media_storage_bytes` quota tracking on upload/delete via existing `TrackWorkspaceQuotaUsageService`
  - [x] M1j — `mediaClasses` capability activation from plan entitlements (replace hardcoded false)
  - [x] M1k — contracts: attachment schemas in web chat types
- [x] M2 — tool media delivery (web chat)
  - [x] M2a — OpenClaw bridge: `resolveAgentResponse` returns `{ text, media[] }` from payloads (replaces `resolveAgentResponseText`)
  - [x] M2b — OpenClaw bridge: sync/stream HTTP response includes `media[]`; stream NDJSON emits `media` event after `done`
  - [x] M2c — PersAI adapter: parse `media[]` from sync response and stream events
  - [x] M2d — send/stream services: copy tool media to workspace `media/<chatId>/<messageId>/`, create attachment rows
  - [x] M2e — web UI: `ChatMessageBubble` renders image attachments inline, audio with `<audio>` player, tool_output with appropriate display
  - [x] M2f — web UI: message history load includes attachments
- [x] M3 — web voice messages (send + receive)
  - [x] M3a — web UI: `ChatInput` microphone button + `MediaRecorder` API (opus/webm) + recording UX
  - [x] M3b — upload voice → transcribe via `POST /assistant/voice/transcribe` → receive transcription
  - [x] M3c — OpenClaw bridge: `POST /api/v1/runtime/workspace/media/transcribe` (calls native `transcribeAudioFile`)
  - [x] M3d — PersAI adapter: `transcribeMedia(assistantId, storagePath)` method
  - [x] M3e — turn service: voice recording → STT → transcription as message text + voice attachment uploaded post-turn
  - [x] M3f — web UI: voice message bubbles with audio player + transcription text
- [x] M4 — web file/image upload
  - [x] M4a — web UI: activate paperclip, file picker (images + documents)
  - [x] M4b — web UI: preview chips before send, upload on send (optimistic UI with local blob URLs)
  - [x] M4c — web UI: user message image inline display, audio player, document download cards via `AttachmentStrip`
  - [x] M4d — validation: max file size, allowed MIME types at upload boundary
  - [x] M4e — quota enforcement: `media_storage_bytes` limit tracked via existing quota service
- [x] M5 — Telegram media inbound (voice, photo, document)
  - [x] M5a — OpenClaw bridge: `persai-runtime-telegram.ts` handlers for `message:voice`, `message:photo`, `message:document`
  - [x] M5b — voice handler: Grammy `getFile` → `transcribeAudioFile()` → send transcription to PersAI turn with attachment metadata
  - [x] M5c — photo/document handler: download → store in workspace → send to PersAI turn with attachment metadata
  - [x] M5d — extend `InternalTelegramTurnRequest` and `HandleInternalTelegramTurnService` with attachment fields
  - [x] M5e — persist Telegram inbound media as attachment rows on resulting message records
- [x] M6 — Telegram media outbound (voice, photo, tool results)
  - [x] M6a — OpenClaw bridge: extend Telegram reply handling with `sendPhoto`/`sendVoice`/`sendAudio`/`sendVideo`/`sendDocument` via `deliverTelegramMedia`
  - [x] M6b — tool-generated images → Telegram photo
  - [x] M6c — TTS/voice tool output → Telegram voice note (opus, `audioAsVoice` flag)
  - [x] M6d — all 4 message handlers (text, voice, photo, document) deliver media after text reply
- [x] M7 — Yandex SpeechKit TTS provider
  - [x] M7a — **native OpenClaw**: new `src/tts/providers/yandex.ts` (SpeechKit v1 REST API, oggopus + mp3 output, API-Key + IAM Token auth)
  - [x] M7b — **native OpenClaw**: register `buildYandexSpeechProvider` in `src/tts/provider-registry.ts` + `TTS_PROVIDERS` + `ResolvedTtsConfig.yandex` + secret collector
  - [x] M7c — fix TTS provider selection: PersAI admin `providerId` now propagated to OpenClaw `getTtsProvider()` via `toolProviderOverrides` in runtime context (credential delivery was already wired, but provider selection was broken — always defaulted to OpenAI)

## Step 13.1 Unified Media Pipeline (ADR-060)

- [x] ADR-060: unified media pipeline architecture (preprocessor + delivery + inbound)
- [x] MediaPreprocessorService: audio normalize (webm/ogg→mp3), image normalize (heic→jpg, resize), PDF text extract, video audio STT
- [x] InboundMediaService: unified resolve() replacing per-channel buildAttachmentContext + enrichMessageWithAttachments
- [x] MediaDeliveryService: unified deliver() replacing per-channel persistToolMediaAttachments
- [x] ChannelMediaAdapter interface + WebMediaAdapter + TelegramMediaAdapter
- [x] Delivery boundary clarified: PersAI owns media preprocessing, persistence, and orchestration; Telegram Bot API sends still execute in the OpenClaw bridge from turn response media payloads
- [x] Refactor StreamWebChatTurnService to use InboundMediaService + MediaDeliveryService
- [x] Refactor SendWebChatTurnService to use InboundMediaService + MediaDeliveryService
- [x] Refactor HandleInternalTelegramTurnService to use InboundMediaService
- [x] Remove duplicated media logic from turn services (~200 lines)
- [x] Module registration with factory-based adapter injection

## Step 14 Tech Debt, Scale, and Platform Hardening

- [x] H16-hygiene — Autonomous workspace immediate hygiene (landed)
  - [x] H16-hygiene-a — `BOOTSTRAP.md` is now one-time/consumed: deleted from workspace after first successful bootstrap read, re-created only on full reset/recreate
  - [x] H16-hygiene-b — heartbeat/background polling uses a dedicated background session key (`__bg_heartbeat`), separated from user assistant turn sessions
  - [x] H16-hygiene-c — background default-model selection follows PersAI admin global settings (`defaultModelKey`) instead of hardcoded `gpt-4.1`
- [x] S14a — Assistant persona identity hardening
  - [x] S14a1 — persistent `assistantGender` field (`male` / `female` / `neutral`): schema (`draft_assistant_gender`, `snapshot_assistant_gender`), API (create/edit/publish/preview), UI (setup wizard + settings)
  - [x] S14a2 — remove `other` from gender options; `normalizeAssistantGender` centralizes validation
  - [x] S14a3 — bootstrap template `{{assistant_gender_line}}` placeholder in `SOUL.md` / `IDENTITY.md` presets + SQL migration + admin preset editor update
  - [x] S14a4 — personality description free-text field in creation wizard (parity with edit flow)
  - [x] S14a5 — avatar `blob:` URL client-side cache (`AVATAR_BLOB_CACHE`) — eliminates re-fetch on every mount
- [x] S14b — Runtime-backed setup preview
  - [x] S14b1 — `PreviewAssistantSetupService`: backend-owned transient materialization for wizard last-page preview (no persistent side effects)
  - [x] S14b2 — `POST /api/v1/assistant/setup/preview` endpoint + ClerkAuthMiddleware route registration
  - [x] S14b3 — robust token refresh in setup wizard (fresh token per API call in `persistDraftForPreview`)
- [x] S14c — Admin Ops Cockpit v2
  - [x] S14c1 — user directory: `GET /api/v1/admin/ops/users` (paginated, searchable), `AdminOpsUserDirectoryService`
  - [x] S14c2 — user-scoped cockpit view: `GET /api/v1/admin/ops/cockpit?userId=` loads any user's cockpit data
  - [x] S14c3 — per-user reapply: `POST /api/v1/admin/ops/users/:userId/reapply`
  - [x] S14c4 — full user delete: `DELETE /api/v1/admin/ops/users/:userId`, `AdminDeleteUserService` (cascade across all tables + OpenClaw runtime workspace reset), self-delete protection
  - [x] S14c5 — compact 3+2 column layout, truncated UUIDs, dynamic header
- [x] S14d — OpenClaw TTS refactor: remove directive pipeline, switch to tool-call-only path
  - [x] S14d1 — strip `resolveAgentResponseWithTts`, `normalizeTtsDirectives`, `stripTtsDirectives`, `createTtsDeltaStripper`, `flushTtsDeltaStripper` from `persai-runtime-agent-turn.ts`
  - [x] S14d2 — remove `outputDir` pass-through from `maybeApplyTtsToPayload`
  - [x] S14d3 — set `tts.auto: "off"` in `values-dev.yaml`
- [x] S14e — Bug fixes
  - [x] S14e1 — `Session expired` on preview: missing `ClerkAuthMiddleware` route for `POST /api/v1/assistant/setup/preview`
  - [x] S14e2 — `formality` slider inconsistency (trait key mismatch in setup wizard)
  - [x] S14e3 — MIME type normalization: strip `;charset=…` parameters in `MediaPreprocessorService`
  - [x] S14e4 — user data prefill (birthday, gender, timezone) during assistant recreation
- [x] S14f — UI/UX MVP polish
  - [x] S14f1 — mobile chat UX: responsive sidebar (hamburger toggle), touch-friendly message bubbles, bottom-anchored input, safe-area padding
  - [x] S14f2 — auto chat naming: new chats derive title from first ~50 characters of user's initial message (backend `PrepareAssistantInboundTurnService`)
  - [x] S14f3 — custom authentication UI: fully custom sign-in, sign-up, SSO callback, and profile pages using Clerk hooks (`useSignIn`, `useSignUp`, `useUser`, `useClerk`) replacing all prebuilt Clerk components
  - [x] S14f4 — Clerk theme integration: `ClerkProvider` `appearance` prop wired to CSS variables (`--accent`, `--surface-raised`, etc.) + safety-net CSS overrides for full visual consistency
  - [x] S14f5 — color theme refinements: warm green accent palette, improved dark/light mode contrast, resolved "muddy" dark theme and light code-block visibility issues
- [x] S14g — i18n localization (EN + RU)
  - [x] S14g1 — `next-intl` infrastructure: `i18n/request.ts` (locale detection via cookie → Accept-Language → fallback), `NextIntlClientProvider` in root layout, `next.config.ts` plugin
  - [x] S14g2 — `messages/en.json`: ~300+ strings organized by namespace (landing, auth, chat, sidebar, home, setup, settings, telegram, profile, persona, errors, common)
  - [x] S14g3 — `messages/ru.json`: product-quality Russian copy (friendly "ты" tone, clear CTAs, soft error messages, adapted trait/gender labels)
  - [x] S14g4 — string migration: all user-facing components migrated to `useTranslations`/`getTranslations` with `t()` calls (auth, chat, sidebar, home, setup wizard, settings, telegram, profile, app-shell)
  - [x] S14g5 — `assistant-persona.ts` refactored to provide translation keys (`labelKey`, `labelLeftKey`/`labelRightKey`) instead of hardcoded English strings
  - [x] S14g6 — language switcher: Globe icon in sidebar, EN/RU dropdown, `persai-locale` cookie persistence

## Step 15 Tiered OpenClaw Runtime and Production Hardening (ADR-063)

- [x] R15a — docs-first runtime program alignment
  - [x] ADR-063: one combined program for shared-runtime hardening + tiered routing
  - [x] detailed execution plan: `docs/OPENCLAW-SAAS-RUNTIME-PLAN.md`
  - [x] architecture / roadmap / test-plan alignment without deepening one-runtime legacy assumptions
- [x] R15b — shared runtime production hardening baseline
  - [x] explicit deny-by-default user-facing tool surface for PersAI runtime turns
  - [x] explicit OpenClaw sandbox/workspace-access/resource limits in Helm/config
  - [x] internal runtime/network boundary hardening in GKE before paid rollout
  - [x] split public API traffic from internal runtime endpoints so `api/v1/internal/*` no longer shares the same externally reachable service/port
  - [x] enforce API ingress `NetworkPolicy` after trusted public ingress CIDRs are explicitly configured
  - [x] add repeatable `shared-runtime:readiness` gate so prepared hardening baseline is validated before rollout
  - [x] split runtime auth into distinct inbound `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` vs outbound `PERSAI_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`
  - [x] add repeatable `networkpolicy:readiness` gate so CIDR-dependent rollout is checked before auto-sync deploy
  - [x] document one canonical pre-prod merge gate for agents/operators before CIDR-dependent auto-sync rollout
  - [x] add required `PERSAI_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` to secret source-of-truth and verify it reached Kubernetes before delivery
- [x] R15c — OpenClaw fork audit automation
  - [x] code-first fork inventory from `persai-fork-base..HEAD`
  - [x] invariant checks for high-risk native patches beyond `docs/PERSAI-FORK-PATCHES.md`
  - [x] CI/agent gate for undocumented or unverified high-risk drift
  - [x] canonical upstream merge gate command for agents/operators
  - [x] targeted runtime/security smoke pack linked after the gate
  - [x] clear current strict-gate blockers by documenting or removing undocumented high-risk fork files (`src/config/zod-schema.core.ts`, `src/secrets/configure.ts`)
- [x] R15d — runtime assignment control plane
  - [x] runtime tier model with plan defaults and admin overrides
  - [x] UI selects runtime policy/isolation level, not pod/service topology
  - [x] materialization emits resolved runtime assignment state (`plan default -> override -> effective tier`)
  - [x] no new admin/runtime flow may assume one permanent global runtime endpoint
- [x] R15e — GKE tiered runtime pools
  - [x] per-tier deployment/service/config scaffolding with explicit pool services and direct tier URLs
  - [x] `free_shared_restricted`
  - [x] `paid_shared_restricted`
  - [x] `paid_isolated`
  - [x] per-tier deployment/service/config/network readiness while keeping one PersAI control plane
  - [x] sandbox activation gate: sandbox-enabled pools launch with real Docker-backed runtime paths, preload published `openclaw-sandbox*` images via Workload Identity/GAR reader, mirror bind-source workspace paths into `docker-dind`, and are live-verified on web + Telegram after fresh pod rollout
  - [x] bounded rollback + explicit removal slice for temporary compatibility routing
- [x] R15f — adapter/runtime router
  - [x] remove the single-runtime assumption from the OpenClaw adapter boundary
  - [x] route apply/chat/stream/channel turns to the correct runtime tier without breaking existing users
- [x] R15g — clean migration and cutover
  - [x] test users migrate directly to the tiered model with repeatable live proof from materialized `effectiveTier` plus adapter `runtime_route` logs
  - [x] do not preserve new legacy around “single shared runtime forever”; live cutover checks identify the actual pool host used for runtime bridge calls and sandbox-capable shared pools recover automatically after fresh pod rollout

## Pending / Future

- [x] K16 — Post-R15 security governance and admin control-plane hardening
  - [x] K16a — separate plan-managed vs hidden-internal tool policy truth so runtime materialization, admin plan API, and user-visible tool docs no longer rely on the old raw activation rows alone
    - Admin plans now expose the same three-way tool policy split the control plane uses internally: editable `plan_managed`, read-only always-on `platform_managed`, and read-only `hidden_internal`.
    - `persai_workspace_attach` and `persai_tool_quota_status` are now cataloged as `platform_managed` system tools, existing plans are backfilled with non-plan-managed activation rows, and ordinary plan mutations still reject attempts to edit them.
  - [x] K16b — add graceful model fallback on limit exhaustion instead of hard chat shutdown
    - [x] web/telegram inbound turns now resolve `cost_driving_restricted` through materialized runtime routing truth and can degrade to the safe fallback model path instead of hard-failing the chat turn
    - [x] admin plans no longer expose `Cost tool units` as a product-facing edit field; only `tokenBudgetLimit` remains in the ordinary plan UI/API surface
    - [x] runtime transport/UI now surfaces fallback-mode metadata so chat can show a neutral degraded marker instead of pretending the turn used the normal path
  - [x] K16c — expand Ops Cockpit for full-width operator workflow plus assistant-level test plan override/reset
    - `Ops Cockpit` now uses a wider operator layout and shows the assistant effective-plan block directly in the cockpit state.
    - Added assistant-level test plan override/reset flow (`assistant_plan_override`) as a control-plane seam on `assistant_governance`, without mutating workspace billing rows.
    - Effective subscription/materialization precedence is now `workspace subscription -> assistant override -> assistant fallback -> catalog default -> none`, so tester overrides reach runtime truth and not only the admin UI.
  - [x] K16d — file hardening baseline: dangerous extension denylist, stricter binary upload path, and aligned write/upload size rules
    - `PersAI` upload/stage/transcribe/channel-ingress now pass through one shared media security policy instead of separate MIME-only checks.
    - dangerous executable/script extensions are blocked, and raw `application/octet-stream` no longer passes the ordinary allow path unless a safe type can be verified.
    - `persai_workspace_attach` and OpenClaw runtime media upload now enforce the same class of file hardening on the runtime side, reducing bypass paths through workspace files/tool output.
    - tool-output persistence now validates downloaded artifacts before re-uploading them into runtime storage, and the API upload endpoints now share the same max-size constant as the media policy layer instead of carrying separate hardcoded limits.
  - [x] K16e — explicit per-tier security matrix for `free_shared_restricted`, `paid_shared_restricted`, and `paid_isolated`
    - PersAI now has a code-backed runtime tier security matrix (`admin/runtime` read-only surface + contract state) instead of relying on scattered Helm/doc assumptions.
    - All three product tiers now declare the same restricted built-in deny baseline, `sandbox.mode=all` / `scope=session` / `network=none` / `readOnlyRoot=true`, `exec` only inside sandbox, and `write` only inside the sandbox workspace boundary.
    - `reminder_task` remains the only plan-managed service tool in the matrix, `cron` stays hidden-internal, and `persai_workspace_attach` plus `persai_tool_quota_status` are called out as always-on platform-managed tools across tiers.
    - Dev Helm runtime wiring now also reflects that matrix honestly for sandbox sessions: the sandbox tool allowlist includes the actual PersAI product/service tools instead of collapsing to the OpenClaw coding-only default, and the Docker sandbox user is pinned to `0:0` so rootless `docker:dind` plus GCS FUSE workspaces no longer leave `write`/`edit` failing with live `Permission denied`.
    - Live cluster deploy verified 2026-04-05: `helm template | kubectl apply` + pod rollout restart confirmed the full tool surface (all product/service tools) appears in fresh sessions. No OpenClaw source patches were needed.
  - [x] K16f — user-facing tariff and usage UX aligned with the new plan model
    - sidebar now shows current tariff plus token usage instead of the old chat-only progress bar
    - assistant settings keep only token/chat usage bars and list active per-tool daily limits from the effective plan
    - user-facing UI no longer reinforces the old `Cost tool units` product model
  - [x] K16g — production security audit and hardening (ADR-065, ADR-066, ADR-067, ADR-069)
    - [x] ADR-065 (Wave 1): openclaw container securityContext locked (readOnlyRootFilesystem, runAsNonRoot, drop ALL caps). Per-tier resource limits (CPU/RAM/ephemeral/PIDs). Egress NetworkPolicy for all openclaw pods.
    - [x] ADR-066: Telegram webhook tier-aware proxy through PersAI API, removing hardcoded ingress to free_shared pool.
    - [x] ADR-067: media storage quota enforcement, per-peer Telegram rate limit, draft input validation (maxLength + avatarUrl https), NetworkPolicy covering all pools.
    - [x] ADR-069: workspace storage quota enforcement (write + exec guard with cached du, default 500 MB). dind privileged canary attempted then reverted (GKE COS doesn't support rootless dind without privileged). Admin UI workspace storage field per plan.
    - [x] Cross-assistant file isolation (Wave 2): workspace media path no longer falls back to global root.
    - [x] GKE autoscaling enabled for runtime node pool.
- [ ] H11 — WhatsApp/MAX follow-through: extend the current readiness model with Telegram-parity managed `secret_refs`, rotation/revoke flow, and runtime materialization when those channels ship
- [ ] Channel media adapters: WhatsApp, VK, Matrix — add one `*MediaAdapter` plus module registration when each channel ships, and align channel enum/contracts with Matrix if it remains in scope
- [ ] TTS admin advanced settings UI: expose provider-specific voice/model controls in PersAI admin (OpenAI first); current runtime behavior uses provider defaults and gender-based mapping, not the old `[[tts:voice=...]]` directive path
- [ ] H14 — Fork-diff reduction (tech debt follow-up inside Step 15 runtime program)
  - [ ] H14a — migrate secret refs and tool credential injection away from native `source: "persai"` plumbing toward a generated `exec` provider + PersAI API bridge, reducing dedicated PersAI secret-provider fork surface in OpenClaw core
  - [ ] H14b — remove duplicate explicit spec-store wiring from `server-runtime-state.ts` and update the fork verification scripts that currently assert that patch
  - [ ] H14c — stop deepening PersAI-specific native secret configuration UX; prefer PersAI-owned admin/config generation paths
  - [ ] H14d — prefer plugin-sdk/helper seams and PersAI-owned bridge tools before adding new native runtime patches
- [ ] H15 — GKE runtime tuning for 5 000+ users (execution follow-up inside Step 15 runtime program)
  - [x] H15a — tune sandbox-capable pool startup budget from measured preload/warmup behavior; API/web probes already live in Helm values, while broader OpenClaw readiness/liveness parity remains follow-up work
  - [ ] H15b — validate rollout safety and cold-start/recovery latency for `api`, `web`, and tiered `openclaw` pools with repeatable operational checks
- [ ] SR0 — Scaling readiness documentation/control baseline
  - [x] ADR-070 accepted as umbrella governance for scaling-readiness, evidence-first delivery, and clean-delivery rules
  - [x] `docs/SCALING-READINESS-PLAN.md` created as central execution-plan source-of-truth for Cursor-agent slices
  - [x] roadmap/test-plan/changelog/session-handoff aligned to the new program baseline
- [x] SR1 — Platform baseline and observability
  - closed with: honest API readiness, dependency/request/latency metrics, and explicit `SR1` deploy-observation + alert + OpenClaw probe/log baseline (`docs/SR1-OBSERVABILITY-BASELINE.md`)
- [x] SR2 — GKE production baseline
  - closed with: explicit workload rollout truth for `api`, `web`, and OpenClaw pools; enabled bounded disruption/placement baseline for `api` and `web` (`replicas=2`, `PDB`, topology spread); and explicit-but-disabled autoscaling assumptions so infra defaults are no longer implicit
- [x] SR3 — API concurrency and dependency hardening
  - closed with: bounded API correctness fixes for chat-thread creation races, OpenClaw preflight burst pressure, duplicate in-process Prisma clients, distributed `peerKey` abuse throttling, and atomic distributed registration of user/assistant abuse counters under contention
  - `SR3b`: adapter preflight now uses short TTL caching plus in-flight dedup per runtime tier, reducing burst-time dependency pressure from repeated `/healthz` + `/readyz` checks on nearby runtime calls
  - `SR3c`: API no longer opens two separate Prisma clients/pools for identity-access vs workspace-management in the same process; workspace-management now aliases the shared Prisma singleton
  - `SR3d`: peer abuse throttling for `peerKey`-based inbound paths is no longer process-local memory only; the peer counter now persists and increments atomically in Postgres so the touched Telegram path keeps the same guard across API replicas
  - `SR3e`: user/assistant abuse counters no longer rely on `find -> compute -> upsert` under burst; registration now runs through a serializable Postgres transaction with retry on contention
- [x] SR4 — OpenClaw runtime throughput and multi-replica correctness
  - closed with: explicit single-replica production runtime contract for OpenClaw (`single_replica`, one pod per runtime pool, `Recreate` rollout only), explicit prohibition of multi-replica session mode, and honest identification of the shared global active-turn lane as the current throughput ceiling
  - `SR4a`: runtime readiness now treats PersAI `multi_replica` session mode as not yet supported by code: Redis-backed apply/spec storage is necessary metadata sharing, but session store continuity, workspace continuity, execution ordering, and restart handoff remain unproven across replicas
- [x] SR5 — Sandbox and dind capacity hardening
  - closed with: parallel sandbox image preload (SR5a), per-tier dind contention evidence (SR5b), cross-pool isolation confirmation, predictable linear degradation under sandbox-heavy bursts
  - `SR5a`: sandbox startup path optimization — parallel docker pulls with retry, progress logging, ~5-7 min deploy-gap reduction
  - `SR5b`: dind contention baseline — 4× concurrent sandbox CPU saturation measured on all tiers, linear degradation confirmed, pod stability proven, cross-pool isolation verified
- [ ] SR6 — Storage and workspace path hardening ← **active slice**
  - [x] `SR6a` — workspace quota cache invalidation parity for sandbox `remove` / `rename`, plus docs drift cleanup for truthful `SR6` boundaries vs `SR7`/`SR9`
  - [x] `SR6b` — mid-exec workspace quota watch for oversized single-command writes, plus docs correction after live 17 GB burst evidence
  - [x] `SR6c` — workspace quota measurement fail-safe semantics for `du` failure / malformed output
  - [x] `SR6d` — first-poll quota watch tightening after live evidence that one `800 MB` write could still complete against a `700 MB` quota and only block follow-up commands
  - [x] `SR6e` — known file-mutation quota cache delta accounting reduced avoidable post-mutation `du -sb` pressure on ordinary file-mutation paths
  - [ ] `SR6f` — non-cleanup `exec` no longer reports success after leaving workspace over quota; live oversized-write closure still pending
- [ ] SR7 — Media pipeline capacity hardening
- [ ] SR8 — Webhook and realtime burst hardening
- [ ] SR9 — Billing and quota correctness under concurrency
- [ ] SR10 — Capacity validation and production gate
- [ ] H16 — Autonomous workspace heartbeat deeper isolation
  - note: the immediate hygiene slice above is complete; the remaining H16 work is the deeper isolation/refactor track
  - scope note: separate main-workspace orchestration from assistant/user-scoped autonomous loops so background polling behavior is explicit and isolated
  - [ ] H16a — verify which heartbeat/autonomous paths still read `HEARTBEAT.md` via the default agent workspace (`resolveAgentWorkspaceDir`) instead of the PersAI assistant-scoped `workspaceDir`
  - [ ] H16b — bind heartbeat polling and related autonomous file checks to the correct assistant/user workspace where product behavior is expected per assistant
  - [ ] H16c — document the role of the main/default workspace vs assistant-scoped workspaces so background agent behavior is understandable and debuggable
  - [ ] H16d — route low-value background polling / heartbeat reads to a dedicated cheaper model tier, separate from user-facing turn models

# Test Plan

This document defines the current verification baseline for the active PersAI-native path.

ADR-072 is closed for the native migration baseline through Step 18. Any follow-through work on create/recreate polish, memory/knowledge economics, Step 19 scale hardening, Step 15a, or Step 20 should also be checked against `docs/ADR/073-post-adr072-residue-and-polish-program.md`.

## Required repo checks

Run these before calling a change clean:

```bash
corepack pnpm -r --if-present run lint
corepack pnpm run format:check
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api run typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/web run typecheck
```

Add focused tests for touched code paths when the change affects behavior.

For production slices that touch API contracts, runtime behavior, or shared control-plane seams, also run:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test
```

## Step 20 sandbox/media focused checks

When a change touches sandbox execution, `send_media_to_user`, `SandboxFileRef` handling, or shared channel media delivery, add the focused pack below before calling the slice clean:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/sandbox test
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/sandbox run typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/runtime exec tsx test/runtime-send-media-to-user.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/runtime exec tsx test/turn-execution.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/media-delivery.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/resolve-admin-ops-cockpit.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/send-web-chat-turn.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/telegram-webhook-proxy.controller.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/runtime run typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api run typecheck
```

Interpretation rules:

1. cover both durable `fileRef` delivery and current-turn artifact delivery semantics; do not only prove one of them
2. if current-turn artifacts are reselected by `artifactId`, verify the final runtime artifact set keeps one authoritative copy with the latest metadata instead of double-counting or silently dropping overrides
3. if Telegram delivery logic changes, confirm the shared media-delivery seam receives the real channel target and preserves `caption` through the outbound adapter path
4. if sandbox input `fileRef` mounting changes, verify read-by-`fileRef` works without a duplicate output artifact and that unchanged mounted inputs are not re-persisted as fresh sandbox outputs
5. if the change touches the final user-visible delivery boundary, prove both sides of the handoff: web must persist returned runtime media through `MediaDeliveryService` and expose the resulting attachments on the assistant message, while Telegram must route media through the shared delivery seam and avoid a duplicate outbound upload after that seam already handled delivery
6. if `sandboxJobsPerDay` changes or becomes user-visible policy, verify the sandbox service blocks the request before execution starts, records a blocked job row, and returns a structured quota reason instead of failing generically later
7. if per-channel outbound byte caps change, verify the limit is applied to the final combined outbound artifact set for the turn, not only to one candidate artifact in isolation
8. if `maxCpuMsPerJob`, `maxMemoryBytesPerJob`, or `maxConcurrentProcesses` changes, verify the sandbox service enforces the limit against the full spawned process tree rather than only the root process, and confirm the resulting `SandboxJob.resourceUsage` captures the peak process/CPU/memory truth for the run that completed or was blocked
9. if admin/operator sandbox observability changes, verify `AdminOpsCockpit` exposes the effective sandbox policy plus recent `SandboxJob` truth together: active/remaining daily quota counters must match the effective plan policy, and recent jobs must surface blocked reasons plus persisted `resourceUsage` telemetry instead of raw opaque JSON

## Knowledge/admin focused checks

When a change touches the active knowledge plane, retrieval policy, or admin knowledge surfaces, the focused verification pack should include the relevant targeted tests:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/read-assistant-knowledge.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/manage-admin-knowledge-sources.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/manage-assistant-knowledge-sources.service.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/identity-access.module.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/admin-authorization.test.ts
corepack pnpm --filter @persai/api exec tsx test/runtime-knowledge-access.test.ts
```

## Helm / deploy truth checks

Validate rendered deploy truth:

```bash
helm lint infra/helm -f infra/helm/values.yaml
helm lint infra/helm -f infra/helm/values-dev.yaml
helm template persai infra/helm -f infra/helm/values.yaml > /dev/null
helm template persai-dev infra/helm -f infra/helm/values-dev.yaml > /dev/null
```

Expected active components:

- `api`
- `web`
- `runtime`
- `provider-gateway`
- `sandbox`

No rendered `openclaw*` workload, service, configmap, ingress, or secret wiring should remain in the active chart path.

## Live cluster checks

For `persai-dev`, verify:

```bash
kubectl -n persai-dev get deploy,svc,ingress,networkpolicy
kubectl -n persai-dev get pods -o wide
kubectl -n persai-dev get secret
kubectl get applications.argoproj.io -n argocd
```

Expected:

- only `api`, `web`, `runtime`, and `provider-gateway` workloads are active
- ingress `bot.persai.dev` routes to `api`
- `persai-runtime-secrets` is the active native-runtime secret object
- no `openclaw*` resource remains in the active namespace

## Runtime path checks

Verify the active runtime path from the cluster:

```bash
kubectl -n persai-dev get deploy api -o yaml
kubectl -n persai-dev get deploy runtime -o yaml
kubectl -n persai-dev get deploy provider-gateway -o yaml
kubectl -n persai-dev get deploy sandbox -o yaml
```

Expected env truth:

- `PERSAI_WEB_CHAT_SYNC_RUNTIME_MODE=native`
- `PERSAI_WEB_CHAT_STREAM_RUNTIME_MODE=native`
- `PERSAI_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=http://runtime:3012`
- `PERSAI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=http://provider-gateway:3011`
- `RUNTIME_PROVIDER_GATEWAY_BASE_URL=http://provider-gateway:3011`
- `RUNTIME_SANDBOX_BASE_URL=http://sandbox:3013`

## Final load-readiness follow-through

Core `Step 19` deploy/restart recovery and current `/admin` `System Overview` pod-truth are already observed on the active path. The remaining scale-oriented proof is the final bounded load-readiness follow-through, and it must not be treated as generic speed tuning only.

It should verify all of the following:

1. bounded load evidence demonstrates that the active native path is ready for production pressure rather than merely faster in one happy-path sample
2. the saved report preserves enough rollout/restart/admin context to reveal if the earlier deploy/operator closure regresses under pressure
3. if `/admin` `System Overview` truth or deploy/restart recovery looks weaker under load than in the earlier bounded rollout checks, that regression must be called out explicitly before the final step is considered closed

For the current bounded repo-local readiness pass, use the fixed-scale `SR10` ladder before any execution-side HPA work:

```bash
node scripts/loadtest/run-sr10.cjs --config scripts/loadtest/sr10.local.json --profile 100
node scripts/loadtest/run-sr10.cjs --config scripts/loadtest/sr10.local.json --profile 100,500,1000
```

Interpretation rules:

1. do not claim a safe ceiling above the highest profile with a saved JSON report in `artifacts/sr10-loadtest/`
2. the report must include phase summaries plus admin snapshots before/after phases so restart/degradation evidence is visible alongside latency/error gates
3. the next bottleneck must be written down explicitly after each ladder run, even if the run fails below `1000`
4. `runtime` and `provider-gateway` HPA must stay disabled in active Helm values until the fixed-2-replica path passes rollout/restart recovery and at least one bounded load ladder with honest bottleneck evidence

## User-path smoke

At minimum, prove:

1. API `/health` and `/ready` are healthy
2. authenticated `GET /api/v1/assistant/runtime/preflight` returns `live=true` and `ready=true`
3. ordinary `/app` web chat completes on the current native path
4. if validating Step 20, one real web turn can complete `sandbox -> fileRef -> send_media_to_user -> user-visible attachment` without dropping the artifact at the final surface
5. the cluster has no active dependency on a removed legacy runtime service

## Historical traces

The following may still contain historical OpenClaw references without being treated as an active-path failure:

- `docs/ADR/*`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`
- old Prisma/SQL migrations

Everything else that presents current deploy/debug truth must match the PersAI-native path.

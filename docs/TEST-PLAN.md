# TEST-PLAN

## Quality gate

Required in CI:

- lint
- typecheck
- unit tests
- contract tests
- e2e smoke
- prisma migrate check
- build

## Step 1 focus

- app boot
- health/ready/metrics
- config validation
- requestId propagation
- Prisma setup
- seed works

## Step 2 focus

- Clerk token validation
- app user auto-create
- GET /api/v1/me
- POST /api/v1/me/onboarding
- onboarding idempotency
- protected /app
- onboarding gate

## Step 2 smoke/e2e baseline (slice 6)

- API flow smoke/e2e script:
  - `apps/api/test/step2-auth-foundation.e2e.test.ts`
  - validates:
    - auth access guard (missing bearer token -> unauthorized)
    - app user auto-create on first authenticated request
    - `GET /api/v1/me` state before onboarding
    - `POST /api/v1/me/onboarding`
    - onboarding idempotency (no duplicate user/workspace/membership records)
- Web smoke tests:
  - `apps/web/app/app/page.test.tsx` (protected `/app` calls `auth.protect`)
  - `apps/web/app/app/app-flow.client.test.tsx` (onboarding gate pending/completed branches)
- CI includes explicit Step 2 smoke/e2e step via `pnpm run test:step2`.

## Step 7 P1 focus

- Prisma migration validates canonical plan catalog + entitlement schema.
- Governance baseline creation resolves `quotaPlanCode` from default first-registration active plan when catalog row exists.
- Trial metadata constraints hold at DB level (`is_trial_plan` vs `trial_duration_days` check).

## Step 7 P2 focus

- Owner-gated admin endpoints validate create/update/list flows for plan management.
- Web `/app` renders a dedicated admin plan management section for workspace owners and supports create/edit controls.
- Baseline regression suite (`test:step2`) remains green after admin plan UI/API additions.

## Step 7 P3 focus

- Prisma schema/migration validates workspace subscription state model.
- Effective subscription resolution precedence is tested in API test script (`test:subscription-state`).
- Workspace-wide typecheck/lint and Step 2 regression baseline remain green.

/**
 * ADR-108 Slice 3 — domain port for the workspace VC ledger event table.
 *
 * The table `workspace_vcoin_ledger_events` serves two purposes:
 *   1. **Idempotency gate**: the UNIQUE constraint on
 *      `(workspaceId, kind, referenceKey)` ensures each logical event is
 *      recorded at most once. A P2002 unique-violation from `recordEvent`
 *      means the event was already applied; the caller should treat this as
 *      "already done" and short-circuit gracefully.
 *   2. **Audit trail**: every VC credit (and future debit) is persisted here
 *      with a `kind` discriminator so admins can audit the wallet history
 *      independently of the balance row.
 *
 * This port intentionally exposes only `recordEvent`. The balance mutation
 * (`WorkspaceVcoinBalanceRepository.credit`) is separate; callers must
 * call `recordEvent` FIRST (idempotency gate) and then `credit` (balance
 * update). The order is enforced by the `GrantMonthlyVcoinService` contract
 * and is required to satisfy ADR-108 Slice 3 forbidden patterns ("ledger-
 * first → credit-second").
 *
 * This port is independent of and parallel to `model_cost_ledger_events`
 * (the USD COGS ledger). ADR-108 cross-slice invariant 2 requires that table
 * to remain unchanged in shape and write site throughout the ADR-108 program.
 *
 * Slice 4 will reuse this port to record `package_purchase` / `package_refund`
 * events. Slice 3 only records `monthly_grant`.

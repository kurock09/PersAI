/**
 * Pre-prod polish 2026 / FIX 1, Slice 1.2 — server-side soft-detach.
 *
 * Background. Before this slice, the SSE controller in `assistant.controller.ts`
 * registered a single `clientAbortController` and aborted the runtime turn
 * on *any* client disconnect — both `req.on("aborted")` and `res.on("close")`
 * fed the same abort signal directly into `streamToCompletion` →
 * `combineAbortSignals` → the runtime fetch. So a user backgrounding their
 * tab, locking the phone screen, walking out of WiFi, or simply navigating
 * to a different chat truncated the runtime turn at whatever point it had
 * reached. If a long tool (image_generate, video_generate) was mid-flight,
 * the side-channel never finished and the persisted assistant message was
 * a stub. Telegram parity testing confirmed the bug: lock screen mid-image
 * → return → user sees a half-message with no image.
 *
 * Slice 1.2 splits the two cases:
 *   - **Soft-disconnect** (SSE socket dies because the client tab/screen
 *     went away): no abort is propagated to the runtime. The turn finishes
 *     server-side, the existing persistence path stores the full assistant
 *     message, and the client picks it up via the next history fetch.
 *   - **Hard-stop** (user pressed the Stop button): the new
 *     `POST /assistant/chat/web/stop` endpoint dispatches an explicit hard
 *     abort. The runtime sees an aborted signal and bails through the
 *     existing `client-aborted` → `persistInterruptedOutcome` path.
 *
 * This registry is the in-memory dispatch table that lets the new endpoint
 * find a turn's `AbortController`. Keys are `assistantId + clientTurnId`
 * so two assistants owned by the same user cannot collide when the client
 * reuses a local turn id. `clientTurnId` is already required
 * by the streaming endpoint and propagated end-to-end through
 * `streamWebChatTurnService.prepare`/`streamToCompletion`). Each entry also
 * carries the owning `userId` so the Stop endpoint can refuse cross-user
 * dispatch attempts cheaply (defense-in-depth on top of the controller's
 * normal `resolveRequestUserId` auth).
 *
 * Multi-replica caveat. The registry is process-local. In a single-replica
 * dev/staging deployment (current path) this is sufficient. In a future
 * multi-replica deployment, a Stop POST that lands on a replica which does
 * not own the turn will fail with `404 turn_not_found`; the client falls
 * back to the local SSE-socket abort, which is the pre-Slice-1.2 behavior
 * — strictly no worse than today. Cross-replica routing (sticky session or
 * pubsub broadcast) is recorded as a known residual under ADR-073 and is
 * not part of this slice.
